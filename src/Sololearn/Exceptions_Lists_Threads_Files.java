    //Exceptions: is a problem that occurs during program execution. Exceptions cause abnormal termination of the program.
    //Exception handling is a powerful mechanism that handles runtime errors to maintain normal application flow.

    //An exception can occur for many different reasons. Some examples:
    //- A user has entered invalid data.
    //- A file that needs to be opened cannot be found.
    //- A network connection has been lost in the middle of communications.
    //- Insufficient memory and other issues related to physical resources.
    //So exceptions are caused by user error, programmer error, or physical resource issues. However, a well-written program should handle all possible exceptions.
    //Example can be found in Exception_Handling package.
