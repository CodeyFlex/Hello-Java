        //There are 4 core concepts in OOP:
        //1. Encapsulation is to ensure that implementation details are not visible to users.
        //The variables of one class will be hidden from the other classes, accessible only through the methods of the current class. This is called data hiding.
        //To achieve encapsulation in Java, declare the class' variables as private and provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables' values.
        //Example can be found in Encapsulation package

        //2. Inheritance is the process that enables one class to acquire the properties (methods and variables) of another.
        //With inheritance, the information is placed in a more manageable, hierarchical order.
        //The class inheriting the properties of another is the subclass (also called derived class, or child class)
        //Whilst the class whose properties are inherited is the superclass (base class, or parent class).
        //To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.
        //I will now try to inherit from my vehicle class (look in vehicle package)

        //3. Polymorphism refers to the idea of "having many forms", it occurs when there is a hierarchy of classes related to each other through inheritance.
        //A call to a member method will cause a different implementation to be executed, depending on the type of the object invoking the method.

        //4. Abstraction
